	1. What constitutes a creative web project today?
From what I saw on the slideshow (specifically "Indirect Flights" by Joe Hamilton, I think a creative web project should have some sort of user-friendly interactive aspects. This piece seems to be one big collage of multiple photos with different backgrounds as well...Oceans, mountains, and buildings as well. In order to view everything, the user needs to scroll around the page with their mouse, which I personally enjoyed doing. The interactive aspect keeps the user engaged.
	2. How do each of you wish to employ the web or the internet as a creative platform?
The internet is like an infinite abyss that holds unlimited possibilities. My hope for this class is to be able to express myself artistically as well as expand my knowledge on all forms of art and the same internet I will be working on.
	3. What are your goals in this course?
My biggest goal in this class is to (in a way) master HTML. I struggled a lot with it in MEDP150, so I am a bit dusty, but I truly hope to refresh my memory and become much better at using it/creating my own site!
